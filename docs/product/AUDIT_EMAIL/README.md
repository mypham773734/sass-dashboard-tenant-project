## Key Assumptions

1. Per-tenant email recipients (stored in audit_email_configs table)
2. Schedule time in UTC (converted to tenant timezone for display)
3. Async queue-based delivery (no blocking)
4. Report includes previous calendar day's logs
5. Can resend any report from last 30 days
6. Uses Laravel Mail facade (works with any mailer)

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Duration | What |
|-------|----------|------|
| 1. Foundation | 4h | Migrations, models, entities, repositories |
| 2. Application | 6h | DTOs, use cases, business logic |
| 3. Infrastructure | 4h | Queue jobs, mailable, scheduled command |
| 4. HTTP | 3h | Controllers, requests, routes, authorization |
| 5. Frontend | 3h | Blade views, email template, components |
| 6. Testing | 6h | Unit, feature, security, integration tests |

## Next Steps

1. Review [01-REQUIREMENTS.md](./01-REQUIREMENTS.md) — clarify Q1-Q6 with stakeholders
2. Validate [02-ARCHITECTURE.md](./02-ARCHITECTURE.md) — confirm design decisions
3. Estimate [03-IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./03-IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) — team capacity planning
4. Begin Phase 1 — create migrations and domain layer

## Integration Points

**Existing systems this feature uses:**
- Audit System (pp/Domain/Audit) — queries audit_logs
- AuditLogger (App\Application\Audit\AuditLoggerInterface) — logs config changes and sends
- Permission RBAC — only admins can configure
- Mail facade — sends via configured mailer

**No breaking changes** to existing code — this is additive.
